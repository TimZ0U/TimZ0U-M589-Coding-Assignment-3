function yF = forecast(y, s, coef, H)
% FORECAST     Given some data y, a seasonal period s, 
% and a set of coefficients describing a model of best fit,
% forecast the behavior of the time series beyond the last
% given datapoint.
%
% Parameters:
%   y = length T vector; scalar time series data 
%   s = scalar; period of season in terms of number of timesteps
%   coef: struct with fields:
%       .c: Scalar; constant term
%       .d: Scalar; coefficient of time index 
%       .a: Length N vector; coefficients of lag
%       .alpha: Length K vector; coefficients of cosine
%               seasonal harmonics
%       .beta: Length K vector; coefficients of sine
%              seasonal harmonics
%   H = nonnegative integer; number of timesteps to forecast
%
% Returns:
%   yF = length H vector; the forecasted time series response
%
